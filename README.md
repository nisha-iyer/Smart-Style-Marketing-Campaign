# Smart-Style-Marketing-Campaign
Conducted 3 marketing campaigns for Smart Style which focused on brand awareness, increased sale of products through website, and an increase in the customer volume/traffic at the store.

We conducted a Google Ads campaign for Smart Style to increase its brand awareness and reduce the customer churn.

For doing so, we first did a market research on the company and understood their marketing strategy, target customers and history of profit generated.

After that, to increase their revenue and reach the target audience, we conducted three Google Marketing campaigns:
1) Brand Awareness
2) Increase sale of products through website
3) Increase the customer traffic at the store

As the company's main focus was on the brand awareness, more focus was put on that and Ad Words strategy, various marketing strategies and recommendations were provided for the same.
